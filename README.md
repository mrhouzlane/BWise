# ILGuard 

## Introduction

`Having non-correlated source of risk, so the movement at least do not correspond one-to-one, is better than having just one source of risk.`   -  ETHGlobalOnline 2023.

`Why does banks exist ? Itâ€™s because they offer multiple financial services. They keep money for savers but also can be lenders. What is ILGuard providing is similar to banking.` 

`ILGuard is in the same time, making sure that your money is not going out of range of uniswap pools and thus, you are not been victim of impermanent loss but it is also using that extra amount of tokens that is recalibrated and not used anymore as a lending share, thus enabling you to earn yield thanks to SPARK technology with a stable coin.`
