/**
 * Makes a modified version of the solc input to add state variables in each contract for namespaced struct definitions,
 * so that the compiler will generate their types in the storage layout.
 *
 * This makes the following modifications to the input:
 * - Adds a state variable for each namespaced struct definition
 * - Deletes all contracts' functions since they are not needed for storage layout
 * - Deletes all contracts' modifiers, variables, and parent constructor invocations to avoid compilation errors due to deleted functions and constructors
 * - Deletes all using for directives (at file level and in contracts) since they may reference deleted functions
 * - Converts all free functions and constants (at file level) to dummy variables (do not delete them since they might be imported by other files)
 *
 * Also sets the outputSelection to only include storageLayout and ast, since the other outputs are not needed.
 *
 * @param input The original solc input.
 * @param output The original solc output.
 * @returns The modified solc input with storage layout that includes namespaced type information.
